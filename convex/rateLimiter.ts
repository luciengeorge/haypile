 * Project-wide rate limits, keyed by name.

 * Add new limits as you grow. Use them inside Convex queries/mutations:
 *
 *   await rateLimiter.limit(ctx, "search", { key: userId, throws: true });
 *
 * Patterns:
 * - "token bucket": allows bursts up to `capacity`, refills at `rate` per `period`.
 * - "fixed window": resets every `period`, allowing `rate` calls per window.
